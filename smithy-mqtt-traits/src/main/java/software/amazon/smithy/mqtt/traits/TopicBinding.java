/**
 * Contains computed information about the resolved MQTT topic bindings
 * of an operation.
 *
 * <p>Smithy models can contain a number of MQTT topics that are formed by
 * the {@code publish} and {@code subscribe} traits. Each of these
 * traits resolves to a single MQTT topic.
 *
 * <p>This class abstracts away the process of computing the payload of an
 * MQTT operation. Each topic binding provides the following information:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The operation in the model that created the binding.</li>
 *     <li>The MQTT topic.</li>
 *     <li>The payload shape that forms the payload of the topic.</li>
 *     <li>The optionally present input structure of the operation, which
 *     provides information like topic label bindings.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>@smithy.mqtt#publish topics</h2>
 *
 * Operations marked with {@code @smithy.mqtt#publish} resolve to a single topic that
 * is defined by topic property of the trait.
 *
 * <h2>subscribe topics</h2>
 *
 * Operations marked with {@code subscribe} resolve to a single topic
 * that is defined by the topic property of the trait.
 *
 * <h2>Payload resolution</h2>
 *
 * The payload binding of a topic binding can be resolved to either no
 * payload (e.g., publish operations with no input shape), a structure
 * payload, or a member of a structure. The target of a specific event
 * shape member can be used as a payload in {@code subscribe}
 * operations where an event member is marked with the {@code eventPayload}
 * trait.
