/// This is a sample service meant to exercise and demonstrate different kinds
/// of behavior that the documentation generator should handle. Click around to
/// different pages to see what it can do. Examples for various traits are
/// put into sections matching their sections in the Smithy docs.
///
/// This service uses many different auth and protocol traits to demonstrate
/// how that will look, though in practice most services will only use one
/// or two of each. One important thing to note is the ordering of the
/// documented auth traits. By default it uses the same ordering as the
/// [auth trait](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/authentication-traits.html#auth-trait)
/// if present. Anything not in that list is added to the end. On this service,
/// the only auth trait not present in the list is `httpBasicAuth`.
///
/// For the most part, this doesn't go to any effort to pretend to be a real
/// service, operations and paramters will be named according to what they're
/// demonstrating rather than according to some kind of theme.
///
/// One feature the implementation <b>must</b> support, for example, is the
/// ability to handle HTML tags in the documentation trait. This is because the
/// documentation trait uses the [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/)
/// format, which supports inline HTML.
