[DANGER] ns.foo#Service1: The `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme was moved before the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme in the effective auth schemes for an endpoint in the `@smithy.rules#endpointRuleSet` trait applied to `ns.foo#Service1` at: `/rules/0/endpoint`. Moving the `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme before the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme is not backward compatible since not all credentials usable by `aws.auth#sigv4` are compatible with `aws.auth#sigv4a`, and can break existing clients' authentication. | EndpointSigV4Migration

Moving the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme before the `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme may not be backward compatible if the signing scope was narrowed (typically from `*`). | EndpointSigV4Migration
