/**
 * This ref strategy converts Smithy shapes into the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         Structures, unions, maps, and enums are always created as a top-level
 *         JSON schema definition.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <p>Members that target structures, unions, enums, intEnums, and maps use a $ref to
 *         the targeted shape. With the exception of maps, these kinds of shapes are almost
 *         always generated as concrete types by code generators, so it's useful to reuse
 *         them throughout the schema. However, this means that member documentation
 *         and other member traits need to be moved in some way to the containing
 *         shape (for example, documentation needs to be appended to the container
 *         shape).</p>
 *         <p>Maps are included here because they are represented as objects in
 *         JSON schema, and many tools will generate a type or require an explicit
 *         name for all objects. For example, API Gateway will auto-generate a
 *         non-deterministic name for a map if one is not provided.</p>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Members that target a collection or simple type are inlined into the generated
 *         container (that is, shapes that do not have the enum trait).
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
