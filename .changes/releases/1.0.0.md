## 1.0.0 (2020-05-04)

***Note***: Changes marked with "[BC]" are breaking changes more accurately
described in the specific section. A list of further intended breaking changes
have a specific section near the end of this entry.

### Features

#### General

- The model format version has been updated to `1.0` and contains several
  updates: [BC] ([#357](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/357),
  [#381](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/381))
  - The JSON AST representation requires describing annotation traits as `{}`
    instead of `true`.
  - Annotation traits in the IDL are now provided as `@foo` or `@foo()`.
    Explicit `@foo(true)` and `@foo(null)` support was removed.
- Smithy models can now be serialized to the IDL.
  ([#284](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/284))
- Added a Node-based object mapper to simplify the process of building and using
  Java components from Smithy `Node`s.
  ([#301](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/301))
  - Many packages have seen significant updates to use this functionality.
    ([#305](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/305),
    [#364](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/364))
- Made error messages clearer when encountering duplicate shapes.
  ([#324](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/324))
- Model loaders now warn on additional shape properties instead of fail.
  ([#374](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/374))
- Added expect\* methods to the base `Shape`.
  ([#314](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/314))
- Added `@SmithyUnstableApi`, `@SmithyInternalApi` and `@SmithyGenerated` Java
  annotations. ([#297](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/297))
- `NodeValidationVisitor`s are marked as internal and/or unstable.
  ([#375](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/375))
- The `$version` control statement can now be set to only a major version (e.g.,
  "1") to indicate that an implementation must support a version >= 1 and < 2.
  `$version` can now be set to `major.minor` (e.g., "1.1") to indicate that an
  implementation must support a version >= 1.1 and < 2.

#### Trait updates

- Individual protocols are now defined as individual traits that are annotated
  with
  [the `protocolDefinition` trait.](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/protocol-traits.html#protocoldefinition-trait)
  [BC] ([#273](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/273),
  [#280](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/280),
  [#379](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/379),
  [#390](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/390))
  - Previously listed
    [AWS protocols now have trait implementations.](https://smithy.io/2.0/aws/index.html#aws-protocols)
- Individual authentication schemes are now defined as individual traits that
  are annotated with
  [the `authDefinition` trait.](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/authentication-traits.html#authdefinition-trait)
  [BC] ([#273](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/273),
  [#280](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/280))
  - Previously listed
    [authentication schemes now have trait implementations.](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/authentication-traits.html)
- The `smithy.api#enum` trait is now a list of enum definitions instead of a map
  of string keys to enum definitions to improve clarity and encourage adding
  more properties to definitions. [BC]
  ([#326](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/326))
- The `aws.api#streaming` trait is now applied to shapes directly instead of
  members. [BC] ([#340](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/340))
- The `smithy.api#eventStream` trait has been removed. Event streams are now
  indicated by applying the `smithy.api#streaming` trait to unions. [BC]
  ([#365](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/365))
- The `smithy.api#requiresLength` trait has been split out of the
  `smithy.api#streaming` trait to improve clarity around event stream modeling.
  [BC] ([#368](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/368))
- The `smithy.api#externalDocumentation` trait is now a map instead of a single
  string to allow for multiple links per trait. [BC]
  ([#363](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/363))
- Added the `smithy.api#noReplace` trait to indicate a PUT lifecycle operation
  cannot replace the existing resource.
  ([#351](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/351))
- Added the `smithy.api#unstable` trait to indicate a shape MAY change.
  ([#290](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/290))
- Simplified `aws.api#unsignedPayload` to be an annotation. [BC]
  ([#270](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/270))
- Annotation traits are now lossless when loaded with additional properties,
  meaning they will contain those properties when serialized.
  ([#385](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/385))

#### Selector updates

Selectors have received significant updates:
([#388](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/388))

- Attribute selectors can now evaluate scoped comparisons using `@foo:` to
  define a scope and `@{bar}` to define a context value.
  ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
- And logic, via `&&`, has been added to allow multiple attribute comparisons.
  ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
- Support for selecting nested trait properties with `|`, including list/object
  values and object keys, was added.
- An opt-in `trait` relationship has been added.
  ([#384](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/384))
- The recursive neighbor selector, `~>`, has been added.
  ([#386](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/386))
- A not equal comparison, `!=`, was added.
- An exists comparison, `?=`, was added.
  ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
- Support for numbers in attribute selectors was added.
- Numeric comparisons (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) were added.
- The `(length)` function property was added.
  ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
- Attribute selectors now support CSV values, allowing matching on one or more
  target values.
- The `:each` selector is now `:is` for clarity. [BC]
- The `:of` selector is now removed. Use reverse neighbors instead (e.g.,
  `member :test(< structure)`). [BC]
- The semantics of the `:not` selector have changed significantly.
  `:not(list > member > string)` now means "do not match list shapes that target
  strings", whereas this previously meant, "do not match string shapes targeted
  by lists". [BC]
- Shape IDs with members must now be quoted. [BC]
- Selector parsing and evaluating now tolerates unknown relationship types.
  ([#377](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/377))

#### Validation updates

- Services must now contain a closure of shapes that have case-insensitively
  unique names. [BC] ([#337](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/337))
- `suppressions` has been updated to now only suppress validation events that
  occur for an entire namespace or across the entire model. The `@suppress`
  trait was added to suppress validation events for a specific shape. [BC]
  ([#397](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/397)).
- The `UnreferencedShape` validator has moved to `smithy-model` and is now
  always run. [BC] ([#319](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/319))
- `EmitEachSelector` and `EmitNoneSelector` were moved from `smithy-linters`
  into `smithy-model`.

#### JSON Schema conversion

#### OpenAPI conversion

The conversion to OpenAPI was significantly overhauled. [BC]
([#275](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/275))

- Configuration for the build plugin was significantly overhauled. [BC]
  ([#364](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/364))

  `minimal-json` to reduce the chances of dependency conflicts. [BC]

of AWS specific components, and a complete redesign. Many direct links to
components of the documentation will have changed.
