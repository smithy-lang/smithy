      "description": "Sets can now only contain byte, short, integer, long, bigInteger, bigDecimal,\nand string shapes. Sets with other types of values are either difficult to\nimplement in various programming languages (for example, sets of floats in\nRust), or highly problematic for client/server use cases. Clients that are out\nof sync with a service model could receive structures or unions from a\nservice, not recognize new members and drop them, causing the hash codes of\nmembers of the set to collide, and this would result in the client discarding\nset entries. For example, a service might return a set of 3 structures, but\nwhen clients deserialize them, they drop unknown members, and the set contains\nfewer than 3 entries.\n\nExisting models that already use a set of other types will need to migrate to\nuse a list rather than a set, and they will need to implement any necessary\nuniqueness checks server-side as needed.\n\n**NOTE**: This restriction was downgraded to a WARNING in 1.18.1",
