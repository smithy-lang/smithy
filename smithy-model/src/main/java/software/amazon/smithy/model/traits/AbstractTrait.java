/**
 * Base implementation of traits.
 *
 * <p>This implementation provides an {@link #equals} and {@link #hashCode}
 * that should work for most traits that extend from this base class. Note
 * that equality for traits that extend from this type are not based on the
 * concrete class, but rather the trait name and the trait's {@link ToNode}
 * representation.
 *
 * <p>The Node value of a trait can be provided when the trait is created
 * using {@link #setNodeCache(Node)}. Note that when setting the node cache,
 * the equality and hashcode of the trait are impacted because they are by
 * default based on the{@link #toNode()} value of a trait. This typically
 * isn't an issue until model transformations are performed that modify a
 * trait. In these cases, the original node value of the trait might differ
 * from the updated trait even if they are semantically the same value (for
 * example, if the only change to the trait is modifying its source location,
 * or if a property of the trait was explicitly set to false, but false is
 * omitted when serializing the updated trait to a node value). If this use
 * case needs to be accounted for, you must override equals and hashCode of
 * the trait.
