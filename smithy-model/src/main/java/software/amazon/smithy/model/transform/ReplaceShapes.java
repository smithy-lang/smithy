/**
 * Replaces shapes while ensuring that the transformed model is in a
 * consistent state.
 *
 * <p>This transformer accounts for the following scenarios:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When a member is modified, ensures that its containing shape
 *     references the new member.</li>
 *     <li>When an aggregate shape is modified, ensures that all members are
 *     updated in the model.</li>
 *     <li>When a member is removed from a structure or union,
 *     ensures that the member is removed from the model.</li>
 *     <li>When a mixin is updated, ensures that all shapes that use the
 *     mixin are updated.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Only shapes that are not currently in a model or shapes that are
 * different than the existing shape in a model are inserted into a
 * transformed model.
 *
 * <p>When updates are made both to a container shape and to a member owned
 * by the container shape, the member updates takes precedent over any
 * updated made to the old member referenced by the container (e.g., if you
 * update a structure and change one of the members of the structure without
 * also updating the member in the model *and* you update a member in
 * the model, the member in the model will overwrite the member referenced
 * by the structure).
 *
 * <p>This transformer only supports replacing shapes if the previous shape
 * and new shape are of the same type. Any replacements encountered that
 * attempt to change the type of a shape will throw an exception.
