/**
 * Performs a garbage collection style cleanup of a model by removing
 * unreferenced shapes based on a custom {@code marker} function.
 *
 * <p>The marker function is invoked at the start of each round and passed
 * a context object. The marker can query the context object and mark shapes
 * as needing to be removed. The MarkAndSweep then finds all shapes
 * that have targets to them but is only targeted by shapes that have been
 * marked for removal. These matching shapes are then marked for removal as
 * well, potentially freeing up other shapes to be marked for removal in the
 * next round. This process continues until no new shapes are marked in a
 * round.
