S3 Bucket Addressing
====================

Clients for Amazon S3 SHOULD expose multiple levels of configuration for bucket
addressing: environment, file, client, and operation. Settings for bucket
addressing should be resolved closest to the operation. Most bucket addressing
configuration settings compose together. The following table is a
non-exhaustive list of combinations showing the expected precedence orders for
the :ref:`s3-bucket-virtual-hosting` settings:

S3 Bucket Virtual Hosting
-------------------------

A client for Amazon S3 MUST expose the option to use `virtual hosting`_ for
addressing a bucket. Configurations MUST support the default of using virtual
hosting, explicitly configuring virtual hosting, and explicitly configuring the
`path-style requests`_. When set to virtual hosting, clients MUST remove the
bucket name from the request URI and MUST prepend it to the request host. When
set to path-style, clients MUST NOT perform this action and MUST use the
modeled HTTP bindings for the request.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 20 60 20

    * - Style
      - Host
      - URI
    * - virtual
      - bucketname.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
      - /
    * - path
      - s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
      - /bucketname


S3 Dual-Stack Endpoints
-----------------------

A client for Amazon S3 MUST expose the option to use `dual-stack endpoints`_
for addressing a bucket. Configurations MUST default this setting to being
disabled. When enabled, the string literal ".dualstack" is placed after S3's
:ref:`service-endpoint-prefix` of "s3" and before the region in the host for
the request. Clients MUST have the :ref:`s3-bucket-virtual-hosting` setting
resolved to "virtual" to enable this setting.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 20 80

    * - DualStack Setting
      - Host
    * - Disabled
      - bucketname.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    * - Enabled
      - bucketname.s3.dualstack.us-west-2.amazonaws.com


S3 Transfer Acceleration Endpoints
----------------------------------

A client for Amazon S3 MUST expose the option to use S3 `transfer acceleration`_
for addressing a bucket. Configurations MUST default this setting to being
disabled. When enabled, the string literal "s3-accelerate" MUST replace the
S3's :ref:`service-endpoint-prefix` of "s3" and MUST remove the resolved region
from the host. Clients MUST have the :ref:`s3-bucket-virtual-hosting` setting
resolved to "virtual" to enable this setting.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 20 80

    * - Transfer Acceleration Setting
      - Host
    * - Disabled
      - bucketname.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
    * - Enabled
      - bucketname.s3-accelerate.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

*TODO: Add the other bucket addressing customizations and more.*

S3 Traits
=========

``aws.customizations#s3UnwrappedXmlOutput`` trait
-------------------------------------------------

Summary
    Indicates the response body from S3 is not wrapped in the :ref:`aws-restxml-protocol` operation-level XML node.

Trait selector
    ``operation``

Value type
    Annotation trait

Consider the following *abridged* model of S3's ``GetBucketLocation`` operation:

.. code-block:: smithy

    use aws.customizations#s3UnwrappedXmlOutput

    @http(uri: "/GetBucketLocation", method: "GET")
    @s3UnwrappedXmlOutput
    operation GetBucketLocation {
        input: GetBucketLocationInput,
        output: GetBucketLocationOutput
    }

    @output
    @xmlName("LocationConstraint")
    structure GetBucketLocationOutput {
        LocationConstraint: BucketLocationConstraint
    }

    @enum([
        { value: "us-west-2", name: "us_west_2" }
    ])
    string BucketLocationConstraint

Since this operation is modeled with ``@s3UnwrappedXmlOutput``,
an Amazon S3 client should expect the response from S3 to be unwrapped as shown below:

.. code-block:: xml

    <LocationConstraint xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">us-west-2</LocationConstraint>

Without ``@s3UnwrappedXmlOutput`` on the operation, the response would be expected to be
wrapped with the :ref:`aws-restxml-protocol` operation-level XML node:

.. code-block:: xml

    <LocationConstraint xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
        <LocationConstraint>us-west-2</LocationConstraint>
    </LocationConstraint>

A client for Amazon S3 MUST understand the ``@s3UnwrappedXmlOutput`` trait
in order to properly handle the output for the ``GetBucketLocation`` operation.
