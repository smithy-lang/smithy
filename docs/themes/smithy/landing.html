                <p>Smithy models are designed to work with any programming language, describe
                    services running in any environment, and work with any kind of transport or
                    serialization format. Smithy models are defined in terms of the interfaces
                    and behaviors exposed to customers, but still allow implementation details
                    like serialization formats to be customized if needed.</p>

                <div class="list-header">Balances extensibility and constraints</div>
                <p>Smithy models can be extended through traits that allow service providers
                    to define any metadata they want. Traits in Smithy are self-describing,
                    allowing IDEs to autocomplete their definitions and validators to
                    automatically enforce their constraints. While Smithy is extensible,
                    customizable constraints can be enforced on the model to ensure that APIs
                    adhere to any kind of standard or convention.</p>

                <div class="list-header">Defines resources and operations</div>
                <p>Smithy combines concepts from both RPC and REST, allowing a service to be
                    defined in terms of resources and operations you can enact on them.
                    Explicitly defining resources provides rich metadata about an API that
                    can be used to build higher-level client tooling and derive artifacts
                    from a model.</p>

                <div class="list-header">Why did you develop Smithy?</div>

                <p>With thousands of operations across hundreds of public web services, AWS
                needed a simple way to describe APIs that could adapt to change and support a
                wide range of services. At AWS, we provide our customers with extensive
                documentation, strongly typed client libraries, high-level abstractions like
                paginators, and tooling in many different programming languages. Existing
                interface definition languages available outside of AWS were either not
                compatible with our existing services, not extensible enough to meet our
                needs, or not strict enough to provide the right customer experience.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Smithy isn't really new.</strong> The Smithy IDL is an
                    evolution of an interface definition language that was developed
                    internally at Amazon. Smithy models are compatible with the
                    tens-of-thousands of web services used internally within Amazon
                    and the hundreds of web services provided by AWS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Smithy is built for code generation and tools.</strong>
                    Smithy models were designed for the purpose of generating clients,
                    servers, and documentation in multiple programming languages. To achieve
                    this, Smithy models are completely normalized, which makes models easy
                    to traverse, validate, and diff. Normalization also ensures that every
                    shape has an explicit name to aid in code generation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Smithy balances extensibility and constraints.</strong> Traits
                    are used to extend a model and add capabilities that are not part of the
                    core specification. For example, AWS defines AWS-specific traits that are
                    used to generate other metadata documents that are derived from Smithy
                    models. While extensibility is a key design requirement, Smithy provides
                    a built-in validation system for ensuring that traits are used properly,
                    don't conflict with other traits, are applied only to the correct places
                    in a model, and are configured correctly when used in a model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Smithy is protocol agnostic.</strong>
                    Smithy decouples the transport layer of web services from the data
                    structures and capabilities of the service so that they can evolve
                    independently.

                <div class="list-header">What benefits does being protocol-agnostic provide?</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Most web service customers don't care about the wire-level format of the
                        web services they consume; they care about how they can easily and
                        efficiently integrate their systems with a web service in a way that’s
                        idiomatic to the language of their choice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Requirements of web services and clients change over time. XML was once
                        the dominant serialization format of the Web, but that distinction has
                        now been passed on to JSON. As web service providers grow and face
                        scaling challenges, they might wish to utilize a more efficient binary
                        protocol rather than using JSON or even HTTP.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A protocol-agnostic IDL focuses more on the interfaces and abstractions
                        that are provided to customers rather than bytes over the wire.

                <div class="list-header">What is the difference between Smithy and OpenAPI?</div>
                <p>The primary difference between Smithy and OpenAPI is that Smithy is
                protocol-agnostic. This allows Smithy to describe a broader range of services,
                metadata, and capabilities.</p>
