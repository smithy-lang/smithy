            <h2 class="faq-heading">FAQs</h2>

            <h2>Why did you develop Smithy?</h2>
            <p>Smithy is based on an interface definition language that has been widely
                used within Amazon and AWS for over a decade. We decided to release Smithy
                publicly to let other developers use Smithy for their own services and
                benefit from our years of experience with building tens of thousands of
                services. By releasing the Smithy specification and tooling, we also hope
                to make it easier for developers to maintain open source AWS SDKs.</p>

            <h2>Does Smithy only work with AWS?</h2>
            <p>No. Smithy can be used with any kind of service. All AWS-specific metadata
                in Smithy is implemented as decoupled packages.</p>

            <h2>Why not just use an existing IDL?</h2>
            <p>At AWS, we rely heavily on metadata, code generation, service frameworks,
                client libraries, and automated policy enforcement. Existing IDLs
                available outside of AWS were not extensible enough to meet our needs
                and not compatible with our existing services.</p>

            <h2>How is Smithy different than other IDLs and frameworks?</h2>
            <p><strong>Smithy is built for code generation and tools.</strong>
                Smithy models were designed for the purpose of generating code for
                multiple programming languages. For example, Smithy models are
                completely normalized, which gives all generated types an explicit
                name and makes models easy to traverse, validate, and diff.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy can be extended <em>and</em> constrained.</strong>
                Traits are used to extend a model and add capabilities that are not
                part of the core specification. For example, AWS defines AWS-specific
                traits that are used to generate other metadata documents that are
                derived from Smithy models. While extensibility is a key design
                requirement, Smithy provides a built-in validation system that
                ensures models adhere to a configurable set of rules and policies.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy is protocol agnostic.</strong> Smithy decouples the
                transport layer of web services from the data structures and capabilities
                of the service so that they can evolve independently.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy helps large organizations collaborate on APIs.</strong>
                Smithy allows different aspects of a model to be owned by different
                teams. We use this feature at AWS to allow the documentation teams
                to own API documentation, while service owners control the shape and
                operations of a service.</p>
            <p><strong>Smithy models can be altered for different audiences</strong>.
                Smithy's <em>projection</em> system allows the contents of a model to
                be filtered and changed based on who a particular build of a model is
                intended for. This allows for use cases like maintaining an internal
                and external version of a model and providing beta models to customers
                as part of a private beta.</p>

            <h2>What does protocol-agnostic mean?</h2>
            <p>Protocol-agnostic means that the model is an abstraction that specifies
                the rules and semantics of how a client and server communicate. The
                transport and serialization format of a service is left as an
                implementation detail, allowing them to evolve over time. For example,
                a service owner may wish to evolve their serialization format (e.g.,
                move from text to binary), their connection type (e.g., move from
                HTTP/1 to HTTP/2), or launch entirely new capabilities.</p>

            <h2>What is the main difference between Smithy and OpenAPI?</h2>
            <p>The primary difference between Smithy and OpenAPI is that Smithy is
                protocol-agnostic, allowing Smithy to describe a broader range of
                services, metadata, and capabilities. Smithy can be used alongside
                OpenAPI by <a href="{{ pathto('1.0/guides/converting-to-openapi') }}">converting Smithy models to OpenAPI</a>.</p>
