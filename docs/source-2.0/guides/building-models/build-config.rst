smithy-build
============

Building a Smithy model requires constructing a configuration file,
``smithy-build.json``. This file is used to describe how a model is created
and what projections of the model to create.


.. _smithy-build-json:

Using ``smithy-build.json``
===========================

The ``smithy-build.json`` file is used to describe how a model is created and
what projections of the model to create.

The configuration file accepts the following properties:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - version
      - ``string``
      - **Required.** Defines the version of smithy-build. Set to `1.0`.
    * - outputDirectory
      - ``string``
      - The location where projections are written. Each
        projection will create a subdirectory named after the projection, and
        the artifacts from the projection, including a ``model.json`` file,
        will be placed in the directory.
    * - sources
      - ``[string]``
      - Provides a list of relative files or directories that contain the
        models that are considered the source models of the build. When a
        directory is encountered, all files in the entire directory tree are
        added as sources. Sources are relative to the configuration file.
    * - imports
      - ``[string]``
      - Provides a list of model files and directories to load when validating
        and building the model. Imports are a local dependency: they are not
        considered part of model package being built, but are required to build
        the model package. Models added through ``imports`` are not present in
        the output of the built-in ``sources`` plugin.

        When a directory is encountered, all files in the entire directory
        tree are imported. Imports defined at the top-level are used in every
        projection. Imports are relative to the configuration file.
    * - projections
      - ``map<string, object>``
      - A map of projection names to projection configurations.
    * - plugins
      - ``map<string, object>``
      - Defines the plugins to apply to the model when building every
        projection. Plugins are a mapping of :ref:`plugin IDs <plugin-id>` to
        plugin-specific configuration objects.
    * - ignoreMissingPlugins
      - ``bool``
      - If a plugin can't be found, Smithy will by default fail the build. This
        setting can be set to ``true`` to allow the build to progress even if
        a plugin can't be found on the classpath.
    * - maven
      - :ref:`maven-configuration` structure
      - Defines Java Maven dependencies needed to build the model.
        Dependencies are used to bring in model imports, build plugins,
        validators, transforms, and other extensions.

The following is an example ``smithy-build.json`` configuration:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "outputDirectory": "build/output",
        "sources": ["model"],
        "imports": ["foo.json", "some/directory"],
        "maven": {
            "dependencies": [
                "software.amazon.smithy:smithy-aws-traits:__smithy_version__"
            ]
        },
        "projections": {
            "my-abstract-projection": {
                "abstract": true
            },
            "projection-name": {
                "imports": ["projection-specific-imports/"],
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "excludeShapesByTag",
                        "args": {
                            "tags": ["internal", "beta", "..."]
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "excludeShapesByTrait",
                        "args": {
                            "traits": ["internal"]
                        }
                    }
                ],
                "plugins": {
                    "plugin-name": {
                        "plugin-config": "value"
                    },
                    "run::custom-artifact-name": {
                        "command": ["my-codegenerator", "--debug"]
                    },
                    "...": {}
                }
            }
        },
        "plugins": {
            "plugin-name": {
                "plugin-config": "value"
            },
            "...": {}
        }
    }

.. _plugin-id:

Plugin ID and artifact names
============================

A plugin ID defines a *plugin name* and *artifact name* in the form of
``plugin-name::artifact-name``.

* ``plugin-name`` is the name of the plugin Smithy finds and runs with the
  plugin-specific configuration.
* ``artifact-name`` is the optional artifact name and directory where the
  plugin writes artifacts. If no ``::artifact-name`` is specific,
  the artifact name defaults to the plugin name. No two plugin IDs in a
  single projection can use the same artifact name.

The following example shows that the :ref:`run-plugin` can be used in the
same projection multiple times using a custom artifact name.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "source": {
                "plugins": {
                    "run::foo": {
                        "command": ["sh", "foo.sh"]
                    },
                    "run::baz": {
                        "command": ["baz", "-a", "A"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

The above example will generate source projection artifacts in the
"source/foo" and "source/baz" directories.

.. seealso:: :ref:`projection-artifacts`


.. _maven-configuration:

Maven configuration
===================

Maven dependencies and repositories can be defined in smithy-build.json files,
and the Smithy CLI will automatically resolve these dependencies using the
`Apache Maven`_ dependency resolver.

The ``maven`` property accepts the following configuration:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - dependencies
      - ``[string]``
      - A list of Maven dependency coordinates in the form of
        ``groupId:artifactId:version``. The Smithy CLI will search each
        registered Maven repository for the dependency.
    * - repositories
      - ``[`` :ref:`maven-repositories` ``]``
      - A list of Maven repositories to search for dependencies. If no
        repositories are defined and the :ref:`SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS environment variable <SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS>`
        is not defined, then this value defaults to `Maven Central`_.


Dependency versions
-------------------

Maven dependencies are defined using GAV coordinates
(``groupId:artifactId:version``). The version of a dependency can specify
*version requirements* that are used to control how versions are resolved.
Requirements can be given as *soft requirements*, meaning the version can be
replaced by other versions found in the dependency graph. Hard requirements
can be used to mandate a particular version and override soft requirements.
Maven picks the highest version of each project that satisfies all the hard
requirements of the dependencies on that project. If no version satisfies
all the hard requirements, dependency resolution fails.

The following table demonstrates version requirement syntax as defined in
the `official Maven documentation`_:

.. list-table:: Dependency version syntax
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 20 80

    * - Version
      - Description
    * - ``1.0``
      - Soft requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 if no other version appears earlier
        in the dependency tree.
    * - ``[1.0]``
      - Hard requirement for 1.0. Use 1.0 and only 1.0.
    * - ``(,1.0]``
      - Hard requirement for any version <= 1.0.
    * - ``[1.2,1.3]``
      - Hard requirement for any version between 1.2 and 1.3 inclusive.
    * - ``[1.0,2.0)``
      - 1.0 <= x < 2.0; Hard requirement for any version between 1.0 inclusive
        and 2.0 exclusive.
    * - ``[1.5,)``
      - Hard requirement for any version greater than or equal to 1.5.
    * - ``(,1.0],[1.2,)``
      - Multiple requirements are separated by commas. This requirement
        forbids version 1.1 by adding a hard requirement for any version less
        than or equal to 1.0 or greater than or equal to 1.2.
    * - ``(,1.1),(1.1,)``
      - Hard requirement for any version except 1.1 (for example, if 1.1
        has a critical vulnerability).


Unsupported version requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* LATEST, RELEASE, latest-status, and latest.* versions are not supported.
* Gradle style ``+`` versions are not supported.


.. _maven-repositories:

Maven Repositories
------------------

The ``repositories`` property accepts a list of structures that each accept
the following configuration:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - url
      - ``string``
      - The URL of the repository (for example, ``https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2``).
    * - httpCredentials
      - ``string``
      - HTTP basic or digest credentials to use with the repository.
        Credentials are provided in the form of "username:password".

        .. warning::

            Credentials SHOULD NOT be defined statically in a smithy-build.json
            file. Instead, use :ref:`environment variables <build_envars>` to
            keep credentials out of source control.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "maven": {
            "repositories": [
                {
                    "url": "https://my_domain-111122223333.d.codeartifact.region.amazonaws.com/maven/my_repo/",
                    "httpCredentials": "aws:${CODEARTIFACT_AUTH_TOKEN}"
                }
            ],
            "dependencies": [
                "software.amazon.smithy:smithy-aws-traits:__smithy_version__"
            ]
        }
    }


.. _SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS:

SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS environment variable
---------------------------------------

When using the Smithy CLI, the ``SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS`` environment variable can
be used to configure Maven repositories automatically. The
``SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS`` environment variable is a pipe-delimited value (``|``)
that contains the URL of each repository to use.

.. code-block::

    SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS="https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2|https://example.repo.com/maven"

Credentials can be provided in the URL. For example:

.. code-block::

    SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS='https://user:password@example.repo.com/maven'

When repositories are provided through the ``SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS`` environment
variable, no default repositories are assumed when resolving the
``maven.repositories`` setting.

.. important::

    Repositories defined in ``SMITHY_MAVEN_REPOS`` take precedence over
    repositories defined through smithy-build.json configuration.


.. _projections:

Projections
===========

A projection of a model is a filtered and modified version of a Smithy model
that is intended for specific audiences or customers. Projections are
useful to companies that maintain internal and external versions of an API
or include parameters and operations that are available to only a subset of
their customers.

Projections are defined in the smithy-build.json file in the ``projections``
property. Projection names MUST match the following pattern:

.. code-block::

    ^[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9\\-_.]*$

A projection accepts the following configuration:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - abstract
      - ``boolean``
      - Defines the projection as a placeholder that other projections apply.
        Smithy will not build artifacts for abstract projections. Abstract
        projections must not define ``imports`` or ``plugins``.
    * - imports
      - ``[string]``
      - Provides a list of relative imports to include when building this
        specific projection (in addition to any imports defined at the
        top-level). When a directory is encountered, all files in the
        directory tree are imported. Note: imports are relative to the
        configuration file.
    * - transforms
      - ``list<Transforms>``
      - Defines the transformations to apply to the projection.
        Transformations are used to remove shapes, remove traits, modify trait
        contents, and any other kind of transformation necessary for the
        projection. Transforms are applied in the order defined.
    * - plugins
      - ``map<string, object>``
      - Defines the plugins to apply to the model when building this
        projection. ``plugins`` is a mapping of a :ref:`plugin IDs <plugin-id>`
        to plugin-specific configuration objects. smithy-build will attempt
        to resolve plugin names using `Java SPI`_ to locate an instance of
        ``software.amazon.smithy.build.SmithyBuildPlugin`` that returns a
        matching name when calling ``getName``. smithy-build will emit a
        warning when a plugin cannot be resolved.


.. _projection-artifacts:

Projection artifacts
--------------------

smithy-build will write artifacts for each projection inside of
`outputDirectory`.

* The model that is projected is placed inside of ``${outputDirectory}/${projectionName}/model/model.json``.
* Build information about the projection build result, including the
  configuration of the projection and the validation events encountered when
  validating the projected model, are written to ``${outputDirectory}/${projectionName}/build-info/smithy-build-info.json``.
* All plugin artifacts are written to ``${outputDirectory}/${projectionName}/${artifactName}/${files...}``,
  where ``${artifactName}`` is the artifact name of the :ref:`plugin ID <plugin-id>`,
  and ``${files...}`` are the artifacts created by a plugin.


.. _transforms:

Transforms
==========

Transforms are used to filter and modify the model for the projection.
Transforms are applied to the model, in order.

A transform accepts the following configuration:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - name
      - ``string``
      - The required name of the transform.
    * - args
      - ``structure``
      - A structure that contains configuration key-value pairs.


.. _apply-transform:

apply
-----

Applies the transforms defined in the given projection names.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - projections
      - ``[string]``
      - The ordered list of projection names to apply. Each provided
        name must be a valid projection name. The transforms of the
        referenced projections are applied in the order provided.
        No cycles are allowed in ``apply``.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "my-abstract-projection": {
                "abstract": true,
                "transforms": [
                    {"name": "foo"}
                ]
            },
            "projection-name": {
                "imports": ["projection-specific-imports/"],
                "transforms": [
                    {"name": "baz"},
                    {
                        "name": "apply",
                        "args": {
                            "projections": ["my-abstract-projection"]
                        }
                    },
                    {"name": "bar"}
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. _changeStringEnumsToEnumShapes:

changeStringEnumsToEnumShapes
-----------------------------

Changes string shapes with enum traits into enum shapes.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - synthesizeNames
      - ``boolean``
      - Whether enums without names should have names synthesized if possible.

This transformer will attempt to convert strings with :ref:`enum traits <enum-trait>`
into enum shapes. To successfully convert to an enum shape, each enum
definition within the source enum trait must have a ``name`` property, or the
``synthesizeNames`` transform config option must be enabled. By default, ``synthesizeNames``
is disabled. If an enum definition from the enum trait is marked as deprecated, the
:ref:`deprecated trait <deprecated-trait>` will be applied to the resulting
enum shape member. Tags on the enum definition will be converted to a :ref:`tags trait <tags-trait>`
on the enum shape member. Additionally, if the enum definition is tagged as
internal, the enum shape member will have the :ref:`internal trait <internal-trait>`
applied.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "changeStringEnumsToEnumShapes",
                        "args": {
                            "synthesizeNames": true
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

    The :ref:`enum trait <enum-trait>` is deprecated. It is recommended to
    use an :ref:`enum shape <enum>` instead to avoid needing to use this
    transform.

.. _changeTypes:

changeTypes
-----------

Changes the types of shapes.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - shapeTypes
      - ``Map<ShapeId, String>``
      - A map of shape IDs to the type to assign to the shape.
    * - synthesizeEnumNames
      - ``boolean``
      - Whether enums without names should have names synthesized if possible.

Only the following shape type changes are supported:

* Any simple type to any other simple type
* List to set
* Set to list
* Structure to union
* Union to structure
* String to enum

    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - selector
      - ``string``
      - A valid :ref:`selector <selectors>` used to exclude shapes.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {

                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

    This transformer does not remove shapes from the prelude.

.. _excludeShapesByTag-transform:

                ]
            }
        }
    }


You can exclude all of the traits in a namespace by ending one of the
arguments with "#". For example, the following configuration excludes
all traits in the "example.foo" namespace:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "excludeTraits",
                        "args": {
                            "traits": ["example.foo#"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }


.. _excludeTraitsByTag-transform:

excludeTraitsByTag
------------------

Removes trait definitions from a model if the trait definition has any of
the provided :ref:`tags <tags-trait>`. Any instance of a removed trait is
also removed from shapes in the model.

The shapes that make up trait definitions that are removed *are not*
automatically removed from the model. Use ``removeUnusedShapes`` to remove
orphaned shapes.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - tags
      - ``[string]``
      - The list of tags that, if present, cause a trait to be removed.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [

                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

    This transformer does not remove shapes from the prelude.


.. _filterSuppressions-transform:

filterSuppressions
------------------

Removes and modifies suppressions found in :ref:`metadata <suppression-definition>`
and the :ref:`suppress-trait`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - removeUnused
      - ``boolean``
      - Set to true to remove suppressions that have no effect.

        Shapes and validators are often removed when creating a filtered
        version of model. After removing shapes and validators, suppressions
        could be left in the model that no longer have any effect. These
        suppressions could inadvertently disclose information about private
        or unreleased features.

        If a validation event ID is never emitted, then ``@suppress`` traits
        will be updated to no longer refer to the ID and removed if they no
        longer refer to any event. Metadata suppressions are also removed if
        they have no effect.
    * - removeReasons
      - ``boolean``
      - Set to true to remove the ``reason`` property from metadata suppressions.
        The reason for a suppression could reveal internal or sensitive
        information. Removing the "reason" from metadata suppressions is an
        extra step teams can take to ensure they do not leak internal
        information when publishing models outside of their organization.
    * - eventIdAllowList
      - ``[string]``
      - Sets a list of event IDs that can be referred to in suppressions.
        Suppressions that refer to any other event ID will be updated to
        no longer refer to them, or removed if they no longer refer to any
        events.

        This setting cannot be used in tandem with ``eventIdDenyList``.
    * - eventIdDenyList
      - ``[string]``
      - Sets a list of event IDs that cannot be referred to in suppressions.
        Suppressions that refer to any of these event IDs will be updated to
        no longer refer to them, or removed if they no longer refer to any
        events.

        This setting cannot be used in tandem with ``eventIdAllowList``.
    * - namespaceAllowList
      - ``[string]``
      - Sets a list of namespaces that can be referred to in metadata
        suppressions. Metadata suppressions that refer to namespaces
        outside of this list, including "*", will be removed.

        This setting cannot be used in tandem with ``namespaceDenyList``.
    * - namespaceDenyList
      - ``[string]``
      - Sets a list of namespaces that cannot be referred to in metadata
        suppressions. Metadata suppressions that refer to namespaces
        in this list, including "*", will be removed.

        This setting cannot be used in tandem with ``namespaceAllowList``.

The following example removes suppressions that have no effect in the
``exampleProjection``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "filterSuppressions",
                        "args": {
                            "removeUnused": true
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

The following example removes suppressions from metadata that refer to
deny-listed namespaces:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "filterSuppressions",
                        "args": {
                            "namespaceDenyList": ["com.internal"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

The following example removes suppressions from metadata that refer to
namespaces outside of the allow-listed namespaces:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "filterSuppressions",
                        "args": {
                            "namespaceAllowList": ["com.external"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

The following example removes suppressions that refer to deny-listed event IDs:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "filterSuppressions",
                        "args": {
                            "eventIdDenyList": ["MyInternalValidator"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

The following example removes suppressions that refer to event IDs outside
of the event ID allow list:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "filterSuppressions",
                        "args": {
                            "eventIdAllowList": ["A", "B", "C"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

The following example removes the ``reason`` property from metadata
suppressions:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {

                        "args": {
                            "removeReasons": true
                        }
                    }

        will include all traits from a namespace. Trait shape IDs that are
        relative are assumed to be part of the ``smithy.api``
        prelude namespace.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "includeTraits",
                        "args": {
                            "traits": ["sensitive", "com.foo.baz#customTrait"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

You can include all of the traits in a namespace by ending one of the
arguments with "#". For example, the following configuration includes
all traits in the "smithy.api" namespace:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "includeTraits",
                        "args": {
                            "traits": ["smithy.api#"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }


.. _includeTraitsByTag-transform:

includeTraitsByTag
------------------

Removes trait definitions from a model if the trait definition does not
contain one of the provided :ref:`tags <tags-trait>`. Any instance of a
removed trait definition is also removed from shapes in the model.

The shapes that make up trait definitions that are removed *are not*
automatically removed from the model. Use ``removeUnusedShapes`` to remove
orphaned shapes.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - tags
      - ``[string]``
      - The list of tags that must be present for a trait to be included
        in the filtered model.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "includeTraitsByTag",
                        "args": {
                            "tags": ["public"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. note::

    This transformer does not remove shapes from the prelude.


.. _excludeMetadata-transform:

excludeMetadata
---------------

Removes model :ref:`metadata <metadata>` key-value pairs from a model if the
key is in the provided ``keys`` list.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description

                            "keys": ["suppressions"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }


.. _includeMetadata-transform:

includeMetadata
---------------

Removes model :ref:`metadata <metadata>` key-value pairs from a model if the
key is not in the provided ``keys`` list.

.. list-table::

                        "args": {
                            "keys": ["authors"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. _flattenNamespaces:

flattenNamespaces
-----------------

Flattens namespaces of any shapes connected to a service into a target
namespace. Shapes not connected to a service will not be flattened.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - namespace
      - ``string``
      - **REQUIRED** The target namespace.
    * - service
      - ``shapeId``
      - **REQUIRED** The service to be flattened. All shapes within this
        :ref:`service closure <service-closure>` will be replaced with equivalent
        shapes in the target namespace.
    * - includeTagged
      - ``[string]``
      - The set of tags that, if found on a shape not connected to the service,
        forces the shape to have its namespace flattened into the target
        namespace. When additional shapes are included, the shapes are replaced
        entirely, along with any references to the shapes which may exist within
        separate :ref:`service closures <service-closure>`.

The following example will flatten the namespaces of the shapes connected to
the ``ns.bar#MyService`` service into the target namespace, ``ns.foo``. All
shapes within :ref:`service closure <service-closure>` with be flattened into
the target namespace, including shapes that have been renamed to disambiguate
them through the service shape's ``rename`` property. Shapes tagged with
``baz`` or ``qux`` will also be flattened into the ``ns.foo`` namespace, so
long as they don't conflict with a shape within the
:ref:`service closure <service-closure>`.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "flattenNamespaces",
                        "args": {
                            "namespace": "ns.foo",
                            "service": "ns.bar#MyService",
                            "includeTagged": ["baz", "qux"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }


.. _removeTraitDefinitions-transform:

removeTraitDefinitions
----------------------

Removes trait definitions from the model, but leaves the instances of traits
intact on any shapes.

You can *export* trait definitions by applying specific tags to the trait
definition and adding the list of export tags in the ``exportTagged`` argument.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - exportTagged
      - ``[string]``
      - The set of tags that, if found on a trait definition, forces the trait
        to be retained in the transformed model.

The following example removes trait definitions but keeps the instances of the
trait intact on shapes in the model:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "removeTraitDefinitions",
                        "args": {
                            "exportTagged": [
                                "export-tag1",
                                "another-export-tag"
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. _removeUnusedShapes-transform:

removeUnusedShapes
------------------

Removes shapes from the model that are not connected to any service shape
or to a shape definition.

You can *export* shapes that are not connected to any service shape by
applying specific tags to the shape and adding the list of export tags in
the ``exportTagged`` argument.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - exportTagged
      - ``[string]``
      - The set of tags that, if found on a shape, forces the shape to be
        present in the transformed model regardless of if it was connected
        to a service.

The following example removes shapes that are not connected to any service,
but keeps the shape if it has any of the provided tags:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "removeUnusedShapes",
                        "args": {
                            "exportTagged": [
                                "export-tag1",
                                "another-export-tag"
                            ]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. _renameShapes-transform:

renameShapes
------------

Renames shapes within the model, including updating any references to the
shapes that are being renamed.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - renamed
      - ``Map<shapeId, shapeId>``
      - The map of :ref:`shape IDs <shape-id>` to rename. Each key ``shapeId`` will be
        renamed to the value ``shapeId``. Each :ref:`shape ID <shape-id>` must be
        be an absolute shape ID.

The following example renames the ``ns.foo#Bar`` shape to ``ns.foo#Baz``.
Any references to ``ns.foo#Bar`` on other shapes will also be updated.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "exampleProjection": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "renameShapes",
                        "args": {
                            "renamed": {
                                "ns.foo#Bar": "ns.foo#Baz"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

.. _build_envars:

Environment variables
=====================

Strings in ``smithy-build.json`` files can contain environment variable place
holders that are expanded at load-time into the value of a Java system
property or environment variable. The syntax of a placeholder is
``${NAME}`` where "NAME" is the name of the system property or environment
variable. A placeholder can be escaped using a backslash (``\``) before the
"$". For example, ``\${FOO}`` expands to the literal string ``${FOO}``.
A non-existent system property or environment variable will cause the file
to fail to load. System property values take precedence over environment
variables.

Consider the following ``smithy-build.json`` file:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "a": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "${NAME_KEY}": "includeShapesByTag",
                        "args": {
                            "tags": ["${FOO}", "\\${BAZ}"]
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

Assuming that ``NAME_KEY`` is a system property set to "name", and ``FOO`` is an
environment variable set to "hi", this file is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "a": {
                "transforms": [
                    {
                        "name": "includeShapesByTag",
                        "args": {
                            "tags": ["Hi", "${BAZ}"]
                        }
                     }
                ]
            }
        }
    }

In addition to environment variables of the process, smithy-build.json
files have access to the following environment variables:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 25 75

    * - Name
      - Description
    * - ``SMITHY_ROOT_DIR``
      - The root directory of the build (e.g., where the Smithy CLI was invoked).


.. _plugins:

Plugins
=======

Plugins are defined in either the top-level "plugins" key-value pair of the
configuration file, or in the "plugins" key-value pair of a projection.
Plugins defined at the top-level of the configuration file are applied to
every projection. Projections that define plugins of the same name as a
top-level plugin completely overwrite the top-level plugin for that projection;
projection settings are not merged in any way.

Plugin names MUST match the following pattern:

.. code-block::

    ^[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9\\-_.]*(::[A-Za-z0-9]+[A-Za-z0-9\\-_.]*)?$

smithy-build will attempt to resolve plugin names using `Java SPI`_
to locate an instance of ``software.amazon.smithy.build.SmithyBuildPlugin``
that matches the given plugin name (via ``matchesPluginName``). smithy-build
will log a warning when a plugin cannot be resolved.

smithy-build DOES NOT attempt to automatically download and install plugins.
Plugins MUST be available in the Java class path or module path in order for
them to be discovered.

The ``model``, ``build-info``, and ``sources`` plugins are plugins that are
always run in every non-abstract projection.


.. _model-plugin:

model plugin
------------

The ``model`` plugin serializes a self-contained and filtered version of the
model as a single file. All of the dependencies of the model are included
in the file. By default the serialized model excludes :ref:`prelude <prelude>` shapes.

To include prelude shapes in the serialized model, add the ``model`` plugin with an :ref:`artifact-name <plugin-id>`
to the ``smithy-build.json`` file with the ``includePreludeShapes`` property set to ``true``.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "plugins": {
            "model::withPrelude": {
                "includePreludeShapes": true
            }
        }
    }


.. _build-info-plugin:

build-info plugin
-----------------

The ``build-info`` plugin produces a JSON document that contains information
about the projection and model.


.. _sources-plugin:

sources plugin
--------------

The ``sources`` plugin copies the source models and creates a manifest.
When building the ``source`` projection, the models that were used to build the
model are copied over literally. When a JAR is used as a source model, the
Smithy models contained within the JAR are copied as a source model while the
JAR itself is not copied. If there are no source models, an empty manifest is
created.

When building projections other than ``source``, a new model file is created
that contains only the shapes, trait definitions, and metadata that were
defined in a source model *and* all of the newly added shapes, traits, and
metadata.

The manifest file is a newline (``\n``) separated file that contains the
relative path from the manifest file to each model file created by the
sources plugin. Lines that start with a number sign (#) are comments and are
ignored. A Smithy manifest file is stored in a JAR as ``META-INF/smithy/manifest``.
All model files referenced by the manifest are relative to ``META-INF/smithy/``.


.. _run-plugin:

run plugin
----------

The ``run`` plugin runs an external program during the build. This plugin is
useful when integrating Smithy's build process with Smithy implementations
that are not written in Java.

When invoking the process, the Smithy model of the projection is serialized
using the :ref:`JSON AST <json-ast>` and sent to the standard input of the
process.

.. important::

    The ``run`` plugin requires a custom artifact name in its
    :ref:`plugin ID <plugin-id>` (e.g., ``run::artifact-name``).

The ``run`` plugin supports the following properties:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 20 70

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - command
      - ``[string]``
      - **REQUIRED** The name of the program to run, followed by an optional
        list of arguments. If the command uses a relative path, Smithy will
        first check if the command can be found relative to the current working
        directory. Otherwise, the program must use an absolute path or be
        available on the user's ``$PATH`` if Unix-like environments or its
        equivalent in other operating systems. No arguments are sent other
        than the arguments configured in the ``command`` setting.
    * - env
      - ``Map<String, String>``
      - A map of environment variables to send to the process. The process
        will inherit the environment variables of the containing process.
        The values defined in ``env`` add new variables or overwrite
        inherited variables.
    * - sendPrelude
      - ``boolean``
      - Set to true to include prelude shapes when sending the Smithy model to
        the standard input of the process. By default, the prelude is omitted.

Smithy will make the following environment variables available to the program:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 25 75

    * - Name
      - Description
    * - ``SMITHY_ROOT_DIR``
      - The root directory of the build (e.g., where the Smithy CLI was invoked).
    * - ``SMITHY_PLUGIN_DIR``
      - The working directory of the program. All files written by the program
        should be relative to this directory.
    * - ``SMITHY_PROJECTION_NAME``
      - The projection name the program was called within (e.g., "source").
    * - ``SMITHY_ARTIFACT_NAME``
      - The :ref:`plugin ID <plugin-id>` artifact name.
    * - ``SMITHY_INCLUDES_PRELUDE``
      - Contains the value of ``sendPrelude`` in the form of ``true`` or
        ``false`` to tell the process if the prelude is included in the
        serialized model.

The following example applies the ``run`` command with an artifact name
of ``custom-process``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "version": "1.0",
        "projections": {
            "source": {
                "plugins": {
                    "run::hello": {
                        "command": ["hello.sh", "--arg", "arg-value"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

Assuming ``hello.sh`` is on the PATH and might look something like:

.. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/sh

    # Command line arguments are provided.
    echo "--arg: $2"

    # Print out the provided environment variables.
    echo "SMITHY_ROOT_DIR: ${SMITHY_ROOT_DIR}"
    echo "SMITHY_PLUGIN_DIR: ${SMITHY_PLUGIN_DIR}"
    echo "SMITHY_PROJECTION_NAME: ${SMITHY_PROJECTION_NAME}"
    echo "SMITHY_ARTIFACT_NAME: ${SMITHY_ARTIFACT_NAME}"
    echo "SMITHY_INCLUDES_PRELUDE: ${SMITHY_INCLUDES_PRELUDE}"

    # Copy the model from stdin and write it to copy-model.json.
    # The process is run in the appropriate working directory for the
