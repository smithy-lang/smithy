Disabling Authentication
========================

This guide demonstrates how to disable authentication on both a per-operation
and a service-wide basis.

Services should, in general, have authentication configured. However, there are
times when authentication may need to be disabled for the service or for a
number of operations within a service. For example, you may want to expose a
public route for users to use to login that does not require authentication.


--------------------------------------
Disabling Authentication for a Service
--------------------------------------

In Smithy, a serviceâ€™s authentication schemes are determined by the presence
of a trait with the :ref:`@authDefinition <authDefinition-trait>` meta trait.
If you do not want your service to have authentication, do not apply any
authentication traits to the service shape.

.. seealso:: :ref:`authentication-traits`

The following example shows a service with no auth trait configured:

.. code-block:: smithy

    $version: "2.0"

    namespace com.example

    service MyService {
        version: "2020-08-31",
        operations: [
            MyOperation,
        ]
    }

    operation MyOperation {}


-----------------------------------------
Disabling Authentication for an Operation
-----------------------------------------

If you have an individual operation or set of operations that should not be
called with any authentication scheme, you can disable authentication by
applying the :ref:`@auth <auth-trait>` trait to the operation with an empty
list as the trait value.

.. note::
    Disabling authentication for an operation is distinct from applying the
    :ref:`@optionalAuth <optionalAuth-trait>` trait to an operation. An
    operation with the ``@optionalAuth`` trait _must_ be callable both with and
    without authentication.

The following example shows a service using the ``restJson1`` protocol
whose default authentication scheme is :ref:`@httpBearerAuth <httpBearerAuth-trait>`.
Authentication is disabled for a single operation, ``LoginOperation``,
in that service:

.. code-block:: smithy

    $version: "2.0"

    namespace com.example

    use aws.protocols#restJson1

    @restJson1
    @httpBearerAuth
    service AuthenticatedService {
        version: "2020-08-31",
        operations: [
            LoginOperation,
        ]
    }

    @auth([])
    @http(method: "POST", uri: "/login")
    operation LoginOperation {
        input: LoginInput,
        output: LoginOutput,
    }

Services should interpret client calls to operations with empty ``@auth`` as
anonymous, skipping credential fetching and authentication for such operations.
