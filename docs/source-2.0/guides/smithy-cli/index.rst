The Smithy CLI
==============

The Smithy CLI enables you to quickly iterate on your Smithy models. With
this tool, you can easily build your models, run ad-hoc validation, compare
models for differences, query models, and more. The CLI makes it easy to get
started working with Smithy without setting up Java or using the
:ref:`smithy-gradle-plugin`.

The :doc:`installation guide <cli_installation>` has all of the information
you need to get started using the CLI. We will be continuously making
improvements to the CLI, as well as writing helpful guides to get you started
utilizing the CLI to its full potential.

If you have suggestions on how to improve the CLI or run into issues,
please create an issue in the `Smithy GitHub repository
<https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/issues>`_.
