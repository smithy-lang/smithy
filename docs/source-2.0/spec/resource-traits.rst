.. smithy-trait:: smithy.api#nestedProperties
.. _nested-properties-trait:

``nestedProperties`` trait
==========================

Summary
    Allows the binding of resource properties to occur within a nested structure
    deeper than the lifecycle operation's input or output shape.
Trait selector
    ``operation -[input, output]-> structure > member :test(> structure)``

    *A member of a top-level input or output structure member*
Value type
    Annotation trait.

By default, resource properties are resolved by looking at top-level input and
output members. The ``@nestedProperties`` trait is used when the properties of
a resource are nested one level deeper than top-level input and output members.

.. code-block:: smithy

    resource Forecast {
        properties: { chanceOfRain: Float }
        read: GetForecast
    }

    @readonly
    operation GetForecast {
       output: GetForecastOutput
    }

    structure GetForecastOutput {
        @nestedProperties
        forecastData: ForecastData
    }

    structure ForecastData for Forecast {
        $chanceOfRain
    }

.. seealso::

    Member :ref:`target elision syntax <idl-target-elision>` is used to define
    structure members for a resource property, identifier, or mixin member that
    do not repeat the target definition.


The shape targeted by the member marked with this trait will have its members
used for resource property bindings. These members may not use
:ref:`property-trait`, or :ref:`notProperty-trait`, and Smithy will not perform
any resource property binding exclusion or bindings with mismatched property names.

.. smithy-trait:: smithy.api#notProperty
.. _notproperty-trait:

``notProperty`` trait
=====================

Summary
    Indicates that a top-level input or output shape member is not bound to a
    resource property. This trait can also mark another trait as a carrier for
    ``@notProperty`` so that if that trait is applied to a member, the member
    is considered implicitly marked with ``@notProperty``.
Trait selector
    ``:is(operation -[input, output]-> structure > member, [trait|trait])``

    *A top-level member of an operation's input or output shape, or a trait*
Value type
    Annotation trait.

By default, top-level input and output members of lifecycle operations must
be bound to a resource property or identifier. Members that are neither must
have this trait applied, or be annotated with a different trait that has this
trait applied.

Use this trait on a resource operation input or output member that explicitly
has a purpose unrelated to reading or writing resource properties. Also use
this traith on a custom defined Smithy trait used to annotate input or output
members for purposes unrelated to resource property modeling such as an
idempotency token.

.. code-block:: smithy

    resource Forecast {
        properties: { chanceOfRain: Float }
        update: UpdateForecast
    }

    operation UpdateForecast {
       input: UpdateForecastInput
    }

    structure UpdateForecastInput for Forecast {
        $chanceOfRain

        @notProperty
        dryRun: Boolean

        @idempotencyToken
        clientToken: String
    }


.. smithy-trait:: smithy.api#noReplace
.. _noReplace-trait:

``noReplace`` trait
===================

Summary
    Indicates that the :ref:`put lifecycle <put-lifecycle>` operation of a
    resource can only be used to create a resource and cannot replace an
    existing resource.
Trait selector
    ``resource:test(-[put]->)``

    *A resource with a put lifecycle operation*
Value type
    Annotation trait.

By default, ``put`` lifecycle operations are assumed to both create and
replace an existing resource. Some APIs, however, do not support this
behavior and require that a resource is first deleted before it can be
replaced.

For example, this is the behavior of Amazon DynamoDB's CreateTable_
operation. The "Table" resource identifier, "TableName", is provided by the
client, making it appropriate to model in Smithy as a ``put`` lifecycle
operation. However, ``UpdateTable`` is used to update a table and attempting
to call ``CreateTable`` on a table that already exists will return an error.

.. code-block:: smithy

    @noReplace
    resource Table {
        put: CreateTable
    }

    @idempotent
    operation CreateTable {
        // ...
    }


.. smithy-trait:: smithy.api#property
.. _property-trait:

``property`` trait
==================

Summary
    Binds a top-level input or output structure member to a resource
    property with a different name.
Trait selector
    ``structure > member``

    *A top-level member of an operation's input or output shape*
Value type
    An object with the following properties:

    .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 10 23 67

       * - Property
         - Type
         - Description
       * - name
         - ``string``
         - **Required** Name of the resource property to bind the member to.

By default, top-level input or output shape members are bound to the resource
property with the same name. In situations where this isn't possible, this
trait can be used to specify which property the member is bound to.

.. admonition:: Note
    :class: tip

    This trait should only be used for existing service APIs that need to
    maintain backwards compatibility with input and output structures, while
    enabling Smithy's resource property modeling and validation.

.. code-block:: smithy

    resource Forecast {
        properties: { chanceOfRain: Float }
        read: GetForecast
    }

    @readonly
    operation GetForecast {
       output: GetForecastOutput
    }

    structure GetForecastOutput {
        @property(name: "chanceOfRain")
        howLikelyToRain: Float
    }


.. smithy-trait:: smithy.api#references
.. _references-trait:

``references`` trait
====================

Summary
    Defines a design-time reference to :ref:`resource` shapes. Resource
    references allow tooling to understand the relationships between
    resources and how to dereference the location of a resource.
Trait selector
    ``:is(structure, string)``

    *Any structure or string*
Value type
    ``list`` of ``Reference`` structures

.. rubric:: ``Reference`` structure

The ``references`` trait is a list of ``Reference`` structures that contain
the following members:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 10 23 67

    * - Property
      - Type
      - Description
    * - service
      - :ref:`shape-id`
      - The absolute shape ID of the service to which the resource is bound.
        As with the ``resource`` property, the provided shape ID is not
        required to be resolvable at build time.
    * - resource
      - :ref:`shape-id`
      - **Required**. The absolute shape ID of the referenced resource.

        The provided shape ID is not required to be part of the model;
        references may refer to resources in other models without directly
        depending on the external package in which the resource is defined.
        The reference will not be resolvable at build time but MAY be resolvable
        at runtime if the tool has loaded more than one model.
    * - ids
      - ``map<string, string>``
      - Defines a mapping of each resource identifier name to a structure
        member name that provides its value. Each key in the map MUST refer
        to one of the identifier names in the identifiers property of the
        resource, and each value in the map MUST refer to a valid structure
        member name that targets a string shape.

        - This property MUST be omitted if the ``references`` trait is applied
          to a string shape.
        - This property MAY be omitted if the identifiers of the resource
          can be :ref:`mapped implicitly <implicit-ids>`.
    * - rel
      - ``string``
      - Defines the semantics of the relationship. The ``rel`` property SHOULD
        contain a link relation as defined in :rfc:`5988#section-4` (i.e.,
        this value SHOULD contain either a `standard link relation`_ or URI).

.. rubric:: Runtime resolution of references

References MAY NOT be resolvable at runtime in the following circumstances:

#. The members that make up the ``ids`` are not present in a structure at
   runtime (e.g., a member is not marked as :ref:`required-trait`)
#. The targeted resource and/or service shape is not part of the model
#. The reference is bound to a specific service that is unknown to the tool

.. rubric:: Implicit identifier mappings example

The following example creates a reference to a ``HistoricalForecast`` resource
(a resource that requires the "forecastId" and "historicalId" identifiers):

.. code-block:: smithy

    $version: "2"
    namespace smithy.example

    resource HistoricalForecast {
        identifiers: {
            forecastId: ForecastId
            historicalId: HistoricalForecastId
        }
    }

    @references([{resource: HistoricalForecast}])
    structure HistoricalReference {
        forecastId: ForecastId
        historicalId: HistoricalForecastId
    }

Notice that in the above example, the identifiers of the resource were not
explicitly mapped to structure members. This is because the targeted structure
contains members with names that match the names of the identifiers of the
``HistoricalForecast`` resource.

.. rubric:: Explicit identifier mappings example

Explicit mappings between identifier names and structure member names can be
defined if needed. For example:

.. code-block:: smithy

    $version: "2"
    namespace smithy.example

    @references([
        {
            resource: HistoricalForecast
            ids: {
                forecastId: "customForecastId"
                historicalId: "customHistoricalId"
            }
        }
    ])
    structure AnotherHistoricalReference {
        customForecastId: String
        customHistoricalId: String
    }

.. rubric:: Additional examples

The following example defines several references:

.. code-block:: smithy

    @references([
        {resource: Forecast}
        {resource: ShapeName}
        {resource: Meteorologist}
        {
            resource: com.foo.baz#Object
            service: com.foo.baz#Service
            ids: {bucket: "bucketName", object: "objectKey"}
        ])
    structure ForecastInformation {
        someId: SomeShapeIdentifier

        @required
        forecastId: ForecastId

        @required
        meteorologistId: MeteorologistId

        @required
        otherData: SomeOtherShape

        @required
        bucketName: BucketName

        @required
        objectKey: ObjectKey
    }

.. rubric:: References on string shapes

A reference can be formed on a string shape for resources that have one
identifier. References applied to a string shape MUST omit the "ids"
property in the reference.

.. code-block:: smithy

    resource SimpleResource {
        identifiers: {
            foo: String
        }
    }

    @references([{resource: SimpleResource}])
    string SimpleResourceReference


.. _implicit-ids:

Implicit ids
------------

The "ids" property of a reference MAY be omitted in any of the following
conditions:

1. The shape that the references trait is applied to is a string shape.
2. The shape that the references trait is applied to is a structure shape
   and all of the identifier names of the resource have corresponding member
   names that target string shapes.


.. smithy-trait:: smithy.api#resourceIdentifier
.. _resourceIdentifier-trait:

``resourceIdentifier`` trait
============================

Summary
    Indicates that the targeted structure member provides an identifier for a
    resource.
Trait selector
    ``structure > :test(member[trait|required] > string)``

    *Any required member of a structure that targets a string*
Value type
    ``string``

The ``resourceIdentifier`` trait may only be used on members of structures for
operations bound to resources. The string value provided must correspond to the
name of an identifier for said resource. The trait is not required when the
name of the structure member is an exact match for the name of the resource
identifier.

.. code-block:: smithy

    resource File {
        identifiers: {
            directory: "String"
            fileName: "String"
        }
        read: GetFile
    }

    @readonly
    operation GetFile {
        input: GetFileInput
        output: GetFileOutput
        errors: [NoSuchResource]
    }

    @input
    structure GetFileInput for File {
        @required
        $directory

        // resourceIdentifier is used because the input member name
        // does not match the resource identifier name
        @resourceIdentifier("fileName")
        @required
        name: String
    }
