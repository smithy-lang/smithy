Codegen Integrations
====================

Smithy Java provides a number of client codegen integrations that modify the code
generated by the client codegen plugin.

--------------
Waiter codegen
--------------

.. warning::

    Only synchronous waiters are supported at this time.

:ref:`Waiters <waiters>` are a client-side abstraction used to poll a resource until a
desired state is reached, or until it is determined that the resource will never enter
a desirable end state. Waiters can be defined in the Smithy model using the
``smithy.waiters#waitable`` trait.

For example:

.. code-block:: smithy
   :caption: model.smithy

    use smithy.waiters#waitable

    @waitable(
        BucketExists: {
            documentation: "Wait until a bucket exists"
            acceptors: [
                {
                    state: "success"
                    matcher: {
                        success: true
                    }
                }
                {
                    state: "retry"
                    matcher: {
                        errorType: "NotFound"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    )
    operation HeadBucket {
        input: HeadBucketInput
        output: HeadBucketOutput
        errors: [NotFound]
    }

Using the waiters integration, you can automatically generate waiters from instances
of the waitable trait in your Smithy model. If you are using the Smithy Gradle plugins,
you can add this integration to your project like so:

.. code-block:: kotlin
   :caption: build.gradle.kts

    dependencies {
        // Add codegen integration as a smithy-build dependency so it can be
        // discovered by the client codegen plugin
        smithyBuild("software.amazon.smithy.java.codegen:waiters:__smithy_java_version__")

        // Add waiters core package as a runtime dependency
        implementation("software.amazon.smithy.java:waiters:__smithy_java_version__")
    }

The code generator will create a class named ``<ServiceName>Waiters`` in the client package.
This class provides a method per waiter defined in your Smithy model. The methods return ``Waiter``` instances based on the configuration set in your Smithy model.

To get an instance of a waiter, call the ``waiters()`` method on the client object:

.. code-block:: java

    // Get the generated waiter container
    var waiters = client.waiters();

    // Get the configurable waiter from the container
    var orderCompletedWaiter = waiters.orderCompleted();

    // Wait for up to 2 seconds for the waiter to complete.
    orderCompletedWaiter.wait(input, Duration.ofSeconds(2));
