===============
Implementations
===============

This document provides an overview of known Smithy implementations and
projects.

Each project provides a *Status* with the following meanings:

* **1.x** / **2.x** / etc: The major version of a stable implementation.
* **0.x**: The implementation is not yet stable and likely will change.
  These pre-release projects may lack polish and may not be easy to use.
* **WIP**: Work in progress; the implementation is not yet stable and may
  not be usable.

    * - Project
      - Language
      - Status
      - Description
    * - `Gradle Plugin <https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-gradle-plugin>`_
      - Java
      - 0.x
      - The Smithy Gradle plugin is currently the only supported way to
        build Smithy models. `Various example projects <https://github.com/awslabs/smithy-gradle-plugin/tree/main/examples>`_
        that show how to setup and build Smithy models can be found in the
        project's repository.
    * - `Smithy CLI <https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/tree/main/smithy-cli>`_
      - Java
      - 1.x*
      - The Smithy CLI is used to load, validate, diff, and transform
        Smithy models. The CLI is used to power Smithy's Gradle plugin,
        and used for other build tooling within Amazon. However, the CLI
        is still incubating and not yet distributed as a standalone tool.

        The CLI can be built from within the Smithy git repository using Gradle
        via:

        .. code-block:: none

            ./gradlew :smithy-cli:runtime

        And then used via:

        .. code-block:: none

            smithy-cli/build/image/smithy-cli-osx-x86_64/bin/smithy --help
            smithy-cli/build/image/smithy-cli-win64/bin/smithy --help

      - Scala
      - 0.x
      - The Smithy SBT plugin transforms Smithy specifications into
        protocol-agnostic Scala clients and servers.

Model converters

      - Language
      - Status
      - Description
    * - :ref:`smithy-to-openapi`
      - Java
      - 1.x
      - Converts Smithy models to OpenAPI. Currently the only supported protocol
        is :ref:`aws.protocols#restJson1 <aws-restjson1-protocol>`.
        Amazon API Gateway extensions can be used with Smithy's OpenAPI converter
        using the `smithy-aws-apigateway-traits <https://search.maven.org/artifact/software.amazon.smithy/smithy-aws-apigateway-traits>`_
        Maven package.
    * - `Smithy to JSON Schema <https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/tree/main/smithy-jsonschema>`_
      - Java
      - 1.x
      - Converts Smithy shapes to JSON Schema using a Java library. Because
        the use cases we've seen so far converting Smithy to JSON Schema have
        been to facilitate converting Smithy to some other format that uses
        JSON Schema or some variant of it (like OpenAPI, or CloudFormation
        resource schemas), no standalone smithy-build plugin to convert Smithy
        models to JSON Schema is currently provided.
