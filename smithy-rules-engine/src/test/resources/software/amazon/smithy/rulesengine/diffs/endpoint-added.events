[WARNING] ns.foo#Service: The endpoint with an `authSchemes` property of [`example`] was added to `@smithy.rules#endpointRuleSet` applied to `ns.foo#Service` at the path: `/rules[0]/endpoint`. The authentication schemes defined in the endpoint authentication schemes will override the modeled authentication schemes, and cannot be easily modified without breaking changes. Ensure authentication succeeds for the new endpoint with clients built from the new model. | EndpointAuthSchemes
