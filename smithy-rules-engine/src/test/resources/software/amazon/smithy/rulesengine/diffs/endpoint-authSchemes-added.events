[DANGER] ns.foo#Service: The `authSchemes` property [`example`] was added to an endpoint in `@smithy.rules#endpointRuleSet` applied to `ns.foo#Service` at the path: `/rules[0]/endpoint`.

Ensure authentication succeeds for the endpoint with clients built from both the current and new models. | EndpointAuthSchemes
