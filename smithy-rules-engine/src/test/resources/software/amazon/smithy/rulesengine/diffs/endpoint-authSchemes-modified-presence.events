[DANGER] ns.foo#Service1: The `authSchemes` property was modified in an endpoint in `@smithy.rules#endpointRuleSet` applied to `ns.foo#Service1` at the path: `/rules[0]/endpoint`. The change may not be backward compatible since the endpoint authentication schemes have been modified. Ensure authentication succeeds for the endpoint with clients built from both the current and new models. | EndpointAuthSchemes
