[DANGER] ns.foo#Service: The `authSchemes` property [`example`] was removed from an endpoint in `@smithy.rules#endpointRuleSet` applied to `ns.foo#Service` at the path: `/rules[0]/endpoint`. The removal may not be backward compatible since the authentication schemes defined in the endpoint will no longer override the modeled authentication schemes. Ensure authentication succeeds for the endpoint with clients built from both the current and new models. | EndpointAuthSchemes
