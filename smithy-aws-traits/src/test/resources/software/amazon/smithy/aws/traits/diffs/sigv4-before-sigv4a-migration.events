[DANGER] ns.foo#Service: The `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme was added before the `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme in the effective auth schemes for `ns.foo#Service`. Adding the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme before an existing `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme may not be backward compatible if the signing scope was narrowed (typically from `*`). | SigV4Migration
