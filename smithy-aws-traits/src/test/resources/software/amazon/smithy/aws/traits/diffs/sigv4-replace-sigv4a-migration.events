[DANGER] ns.foo#Service: The `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme was replaced by the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme in the effective auth schemes for `ns.foo#Service`. Replacing the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme with the `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme directly may not be backward compatible if the signing scope was narrowed (typically from `*`). | SigV4Migration
