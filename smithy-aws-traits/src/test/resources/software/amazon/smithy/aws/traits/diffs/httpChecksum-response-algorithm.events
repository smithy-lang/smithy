[DANGER] ns.foo#PutSomething: Removed trait contents from `aws.protocols#httpChecksum` at path `/responseAlgorithms/3`. Removed value: `SHA256`; Members of `responseAlgorithms` were removed, so newly generated clients will no longer validate response checksums for the removed algorithms. The service MUST continue to support old clients by supporting removed compression algorithms. | TraitBreakingChange.Remove
