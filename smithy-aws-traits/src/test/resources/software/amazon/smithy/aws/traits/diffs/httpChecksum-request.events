[DANGER] ns.foo#PutSomething: Removed trait contents from `aws.protocols#httpChecksum` at path `/requestAlgorithmMember`. Removed value: `checksumAlgorithm`; `requestAlgorithmMember` was removed, so newly generated clients will no longer be able to pick the request checksum algorithms The service MUST continue to support old clients by supporting `requestAlgorithmMember`. | TraitBreakingChange.Remove
