[DANGER] ns.foo#Service: The `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme was replaced by the `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme in the effective auth schemes for `ns.foo#Service`. Replacing the `aws.auth#sigv4` authentication scheme with the `aws.auth#sigv4a` authentication scheme directly is not backward compatible since not all credentials usable by `aws.auth#sigv4` are compatible with `aws.auth#sigv4a`, and can break existing clients' authentication. | SigV4Migration
