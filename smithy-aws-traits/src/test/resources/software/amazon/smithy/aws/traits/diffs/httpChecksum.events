[DANGER] ns.foo#PutSomething: Removed trait `aws.protocols#httpChecksum`. Previous trait value: 
```
{
    "requestChecksumRequired": true,
    "requestAlgorithmMember": "checksumAlgorithm",
    "requestValidationModeMember": "validationMode",
    "responseAlgorithms": [
        "CRC32C",
        "CRC32",
        "SHA1",
        "SHA256"
    ]
}
```
; Removing the trait removes the ability for clients to do request or response checksums. The service MUST continue to support old clients by supporting the `httpChecksum` trait. | TraitBreakingChange.Remove
