## 1.25.0 (2022-09-13)

Made many improvements for Smithy 1.0 and 2.0 interoperability. ([1394](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1394))

### Features

* Default traits can now coexist with required trais. This indicates that a member should be serialized, but it is a
  protocol-specific decision if and how this is enforced. This was a pattern that occurred in Smithy 1.0 models when
  a member was required and targeted a shape with a zero value.
* Default traits can be added to root-level shapes. Any structure member that targets a shape marked with the default
  trait must repeat the default on the member. This removes the action at a distance problem observed in Smithy IDL 1.0
  where a root level shape implicitly introduced a default zero value, and to know if that's the case for any member,
  you had to look through from the member to the target shape. This change allows us to know if a root level shape was
  boxed in IDL 1.0 too (root shapes with no default or a default set to anything other than the zero value was boxed).
* Added the `@addedDefault` trait which is used to indicate that a `@default` trait was added to a member after it
  was initially released. This can be used by tooling to make an appropriate determination if generating a
  non-nullable type for the member is a backward compatible change. For example, if a generator only uses default
  zero values to generate non-nullable types, then the removal of the required trait and addition of a default trait
  would be a breaking change for them, so they can use addedDefault to ignore the default trait.
* Add new NullableIndex modes for testing if a member is nullable based on the supported features of the
  generator. For example, some generators only make members non-optional when the member is set to the zero value
  of a type, so there is a NullableIndex check mode for that and other use cases.
* When loading IDL 2.0 models, we will now patch synthetic box traits onto shapes that would have been considered
  boxed in Smithy IDL 1.0. This improves further interop with tooling that has not yet adopted Smithy IDL 2 or that
  hasn't yet migrated to use the NullableIndex abstraction.
* When loading 1.0 models, rather than dropping the default trait from a member when the range trait of a shape is
  invalid for its zero value, we now instead emit only a warning for this specific case. This prevents changing the
  type and also doesn't lose the range constraint.
* The Primitive* shapes in the prelude are no longer deprecated, and they now have a `@default` trait on them set to
  the zero value of the type. This makes these traits function exactly as they did in Smithy 1.0 models. Any member
  that targets one of these primitive prelude shapes must now also repeat the zero value of the target shape.
* Added an optional nullability report to smithy-build that shows the computed nullability semantics of each member in
  a model. This can be used to better understand nullability semantics.
* Added method to NumberNode to detect if it is set to zero. ([#1385](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1385))
* In ChangeShapeType transform, ignored types changes to same type. ([#1397](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1397))

## Bug fixes

* Updated smithy-diff to not emit events when diffing a 1.0 model against the 2.0 serialized version of the model.
  This means that changes to the box trait are ignored unless the change impacts the nullability of the shape.
  Special handling was added to detect breaking changes with the default trait too (you can't change a default
  value of a root-level shape for example, you cannot change a default value of a shape to or from the zero value
  of a type as this might break code generators, etc). ([1394](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1394))
* smithy-diff is no longer reporting expected `set` shape to `list` shape transitions. Sets are deprecated and
  models are encouraged to migrate from sets to lists with the `@uniqueItems` trait. ([1383](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1383))

## 1.18.1 (2022-03-10)

### Features
* Downgraded set type violations from ERROR to WARNING to give consumers more time to convert these sets to lists.

  ([#1127](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1127))

## 1.18.0 (2022-03-07)

### Breaking changes

* Sets can now only contain byte, short, integer, long, bigInteger, bigDecimal,
  and string shapes. Sets with other types of values are either difficult to
  implement in various programming languages (for example, sets of floats in
  Rust), or highly problematic for client/server use cases. Clients that are
  out of sync with a service model could receive structures or unions from a
  service, not recognize new members and drop them, causing the hash codes of
  members of the set to collide, and this would result in the client discarding
  set entries. For example, a service might return a set of 3 structures, but
  when clients deserialize them, they drop unknown members, and the set
  contains fewer than 3 entries.

  Existing models that already use a set of other types will need to migrate to
  use a list rather than a set, and they will need to implement any necessary
  uniqueness checks server-side as needed. ([#1106](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/1106))

## 1.0.0 (2020-05-04)

***Note***: Changes marked with "[BC]" are breaking changes more accurately described in the
specific section. A list of further intended breaking changes have a specific section near
the end of this entry.

### Features

#### General

* The model format version has been updated to `1.0` and contains several updates: [BC] ([#357](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/357),
  [#381](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/381))
  * The JSON AST representation requires describing annotation traits as `{}` instead of `true`.
  * Annotation traits in the IDL are now provided as `@foo` or `@foo()`. Explicit `@foo(true)` and
  `@foo(null)` support was removed.
* Smithy models can now be serialized to the IDL. ([#284](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/284))
* Added a Node-based object mapper to simplify the process of building and using Java components
from Smithy `Node`s. ([#301](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/301))
  * Many packages have seen significant updates to use this functionality. ([#305](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/305),
    [#364](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/364))
* Made error messages clearer when encountering duplicate shapes. ([#324](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/324))
* Model loaders now warn on additional shape properties instead of fail. ([#374](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/374))
* Added expect* methods to the base `Shape`. ([#314](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/314))
* Added `@SmithyUnstableApi`, `@SmithyInternalApi` and `@SmithyGenerated` Java annotations. ([#297](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/297))
* `NodeValidationVisitor`s are marked as internal and/or unstable. ([#375](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/375))
* The `$version` control statement can now be set to only a major version (e.g., "1") to indicate that an
  implementation must support a version >= 1 and < 2. `$version` can now be set to `major.minor` (e.g., "1.1")
  to indicate that an implementation must support a version >= 1.1 and < 2.

#### Trait updates

* Individual protocols are now defined as individual traits that are annotated with
[the `protocolDefinition` trait.](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/protocol-traits.html#protocoldefinition-trait) [BC]
  ([#273](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/273), [#280](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/280), [#379](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/379),
    [#390](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/390))
  * Previously listed [AWS protocols now have trait implementations.](https://smithy.io/2.0/aws/index.html#aws-protocols)
* Individual authentication schemes are now defined as individual traits that are annotated with
[the `authDefinition` trait.](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/authentication-traits.html#authdefinition-trait) [BC]
  ([#273](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/273), [#280](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/280))
  * Previously listed [authentication schemes now have trait implementations.](https://smithy.io/2.0/spec/authentication-traits.html)
* The `smithy.api#enum` trait is now a list of enum definitions instead of a map of string keys to
enum definitions to improve clarity and encourage adding more properties to definitions. [BC] ([#326](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/326))
* The `aws.api#streaming` trait is now applied to shapes directly instead of members. [BC] ([#340](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/340))
* The `smithy.api#eventStream` trait has been removed. Event streams are now indicated by applying
the `smithy.api#streaming` trait to unions. [BC] ([#365](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/365))
* The `smithy.api#requiresLength` trait has been split out of the `smithy.api#streaming` trait to
improve clarity around event stream modeling. [BC] ([#368](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/368))
* The `smithy.api#externalDocumentation` trait is now a map instead of a single string to allow for
multiple links per trait. [BC] ([#363](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/363))
* Added the `smithy.api#noReplace` trait to indicate a PUT lifecycle operation cannot replace the
existing resource. ([#351](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/351))
* Added the `smithy.api#unstable` trait to indicate a shape MAY change. ([#290](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/290))
* Simplified `aws.api#unsignedPayload` to be an annotation. [BC] ([#270](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/270))
* Annotation traits are now lossless when loaded with additional properties, meaning they will
contain those properties when serialized. ([#385](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/385))

#### Selector updates

Selectors have received significant updates: ([#388](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/388))

* Attribute selectors can now evaluate scoped comparisons using `@foo:` to define a scope
and `@{bar}` to define a context value. ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
* And logic, via `&&`, has been added to allow multiple attribute comparisons. ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))

keys, was added.
* An opt-in `trait` relationship has been added. ([#384](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/384))
* The recursive neighbor selector, `~>`, has been added. ([#386](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/386))
* A not equal comparison, `!=`, was added.
* An exists comparison, `?=`, was added. ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
* Support for numbers in attribute selectors was added.
* Numeric comparisons (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`) were added.
* The `(length)` function property was added. ([#391](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/391))
* Attribute selectors now support CSV values, allowing matching on one or more target values.
* The `:each` selector is now `:is` for clarity. [BC]
* The `:of` selector is now removed. Use reverse neighbors instead (e.g., `member :test(< structure)`). [BC]
* The semantics of the `:not` selector have changed significantly. `:not(list > member > string)` now means
  "do not match list shapes that target strings", whereas this previously meant,
  "do not match string shapes targeted by lists". [BC]
* Shape IDs with members must now be quoted. [BC]
* Selector parsing and evaluating now tolerates unknown relationship types. ([#377](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/377))

#### Validation updates

* Services must now contain a closure of shapes that have case-insensitively unique names. [BC] ([#337](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/337))
* `suppressions` has been updated to now only suppress validation events that occur for an entire namespace or across
  the entire model. The `@suppress` trait was added to suppress validation events for a specific shape. [BC] ([#397](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/397)).
* The `UnreferencedShape` validator has moved to `smithy-model` and is now always run. [BC] ([#319](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/319))
* `EmitEachSelector` and `EmitNoneSelector` were moved from `smithy-linters` into `smithy-model`.

#### JSON Schema conversion

The conversion to JSON schema was significantly overhauled. [BC] ([#274](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/274))

* Configuration for the build plugin was significantly overhauled. [BC] ([#364](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/364))

* The strategy for naming shapes and handling shape id conflicts has been changed. [BC]
* Output schema error detection was improved.
* The Java API surface has been reduced. [BC]
* Added the ability to select schemas from a document using a JSON pointer.

#### OpenAPI conversion

The conversion to OpenAPI was significantly overhauled. [BC] ([#275](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/275))

* Configuration for the build plugin was significantly overhauled.  [BC] ([#364](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/364))
* Protocol conversion was updated to utilize the new traits. ([#275](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/275), [#392](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/392))
* Schemas are now generated for requests and responses instead of being inlined. [BC]
* Fixed several issues with CORS integrations.

#### API Gateway OpenAPI conversion

The API Gateway specific OpenAPI mappers have been updated. [BC] ([#367](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/367))

*  The `ApiGatewayMapper` interface was added, allowing mappers to control which API Gateway API
type(s) they support.
* Fixed several issues with CORS integrations. ([#370](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/370))
* Added support for JSON Patch-like OpenAPI schema changes based on JSON Pointers. ([#293](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/293))

* Fixed several issues with the `smithy.api#httpApiKeyAuth` trait and its related conversions. ([#291](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/291))
* Fixed a bug with timestamp validation in specific versions of Java. ([#316](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/316))

### Optimizations

* The `TraitTargetValidator` now performs as few checks on and selections of the entire model. ([#389](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/389))
* The dependency on `jackson-core` was replaced with a vendored version of `minimal-json` to reduce
the chances of dependency conflicts. [BC] ([#323](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/323))
* Sped up model loading time by loading JSON models before IDL models to reduce forward
reference lookups. ([#287](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/pull/287))
